#docker run --rm -d --network host --name my_nginx nginx
#docker run --name mynginx1 -p 80:80 -d nginx
#mynginx1 is the name of the created container based on the NGINX image
#the -d option specifies that the container runs in detached mode: the container continues to run until stopped but does not respond to commands run on the command line.
#the -p option tells Docker to map the ports exposed in the container by the NGINX image (port 80) to the specified port on the Docker host. The first parameter specifies the port in the Docker host, the second parameter is mapped to the port exposed in the container

docker run --name overlord -p 5000:80 --restart always nginx
